# Phone World Project

## Overview

Phone-World-Project is a static HTML/CSS project developed as part of a college assignment. It represents a mobile phone store website, showcasing various web design elements. This project includes a set of pages designed to demonstrate the visual aspects of a mobile store.

**Note:** This project is a static site and does not include JavaScript, so features like form validation, user authentication, or interactive elements are not functional.

## Screens

The project includes the following pages:

- **Home.html**: The home page of the website. It features the primary layout, including a navigation bar, and discounts. It serves as the entry point for users visiting the site.

- **About.html**: Provides information about the mobile phone store. This page includes sample lorem text.

- **Login.html**: A login page intended for user authentication. While it has a form layout, it currently lacks functionality due to the absence of JavaScript.

- **Our Products.html**: Displays a catalog of mobile phones available for purchase. This page includes product listings with images. It is designed to give users an overview of the products offered by the store.
